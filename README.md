## ðŸ”§ Dicas para Ambiente de Desenvolvimento

### Problemas Comuns com DependÃªncias

Se vocÃª encontrar erros de importaÃ§Ã£o como:
```
Failed to resolve import "react-pdf" from "src/utils/pdfConfig.ts"
Failed to resolve import "@dnd-kit/core" from "src/components/WorkOrderKanban.tsx"
```

Execute o seguinte comando para restaurar as dependÃªncias:

```bash
bash ./scripts/check-deps.sh
```

Ou, alternativamente:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm install
```

### Dicas para Melhor Performance

1. Evite fechar o contÃªiner antes de terminar seu trabalho
2. Execute `npm run build` ocasionalmente para verificar se tudo estÃ¡ funcionando
3. Se precisar limpar completamente o cache: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
4. O script `npm run dev` agora executa automaticamente a verificaÃ§Ã£o de dependÃªncias

### Scripts DisponÃ­veis

- `npm run dev` - Inicia o servidor de desenvolvimento (com verificaÃ§Ã£o automÃ¡tica de deps)
- `npm run build` - Compila o projeto para produÃ§Ã£o
- `npm run lint` - Executa o linting do cÃ³digo
- `bash ./scripts/check-deps.sh` - Verifica e corrige dependÃªncias manualmente

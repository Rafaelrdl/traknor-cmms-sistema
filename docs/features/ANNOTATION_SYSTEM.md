# Document Annotation and Commenting System

## Overview

The TrakNor CMMS now includes a comprehensive document annotation and commenting system that allows users to collaborate on procedure documents by adding highlights, notes, questions, corrections, and warnings directly on PDF and Markdown files.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Annotation Types

- **Highlight** (üìù): Mark important text sections
- **Note** (üìÑ): Add explanatory notes
- **Question** (‚ùì): Ask questions or request clarifications
- **Correction** (‚úèÔ∏è): Suggest corrections or improvements
- **Warning** (‚ö†Ô∏è): Mark safety concerns or important alerts

### 2. Core Functionality

#### Annotation Creation
- Select text in documents to create annotations
- Choose annotation type and add content
- Annotations are positioned precisely on the document
- Support for both PDF (page-based) and Markdown (text-based) documents

#### Commenting System
- Add comments to any annotation
- Reply to existing comments (threaded discussions)
- Mention other users with `@username` syntax
- Mark comments as resolved or archived

#### Visual Features
- Color-coded annotations by type
- Hover tooltips showing annotation content
- Visual markers on document with type icons
- Annotation overlay that doesn't interfere with document reading

### 3. User Interface Components

#### Annotation Toolbar
- Toggle annotation mode on/off
- Select annotation type before creating
- Filter visible annotation types
- Show/hide resolved annotations
- Export and share annotation links

#### Annotation Panel
- Comprehensive view of all annotations
- Search and filter capabilities
- Threaded comment discussions
- Annotation status management (resolve/unresolve)

#### Document Integration
- Seamless overlay on existing PDF and Markdown viewers
- Non-intrusive annotation markers
- Click annotations to view details
- Switch between document and annotation views

### 4. Data Management

#### Storage
- Annotations stored in localStorage with IndexedDB fallback
- Comments linked to annotations via IDs
- Version-specific annotations (tied to document versions)
- Mock data provided for demonstration

#### Persistence
- Annotations survive page refreshes
- Version history maintained
- Export functionality for backup/sharing
- User attribution and timestamps

## Technical Implementation

### Data Store Functions

Added to `proceduresStore.ts`:
- `createAnnotation()` - Create new annotations
- `updateAnnotation()` - Modify existing annotations
- `deleteAnnotation()` - Remove annotations
- `createComment()` - Add comments
- `updateComment()` - Modify comments
- `deleteComment()` - Remove comments
- `getProcedureWithAnnotations()` - Get enriched procedure data
- `exportAnnotations()` - Export annotation data

### Enhanced Viewer

Updated `ProcedureViewer.tsx` to include:

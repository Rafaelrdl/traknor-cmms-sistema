# Procedures Implementation - Issue #20

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive Procedures page with file upload, viewing, and management capabilities according to the GitHub Issue requirements.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ File Upload & Management
- **ProcedureModal**: Modal for creating/editing procedures with drag & drop file upload
- **File Validation**: Supports PDF and Markdown files up to 20MB
- **IndexedDB Storage**: Files stored in IndexedDB for offline capability
- **Metadata Storage**: Procedure metadata stored in localStorage

### ✅ File Viewing
- **ProcedureViewer**: Sheet component for inline file viewing
- **PDF Viewing**: Implemented with react-pdf library including:
  - Zoom controls (in/out/reset with keyboard shortcuts)
  - Page navigation with arrows and page counter
  - Responsive rendering with proper accessibility
- **Markdown Viewing**: Implemented with react-markdown including:
  - Safe HTML rendering (security-first)
  - Styled with Tailwind prose classes
  - Link handling with proper security attributes

### ✅ Categorization & Status Management
- **Dynamic Categories**: Color-coded category system with dropdown selectors
- **Status Management**: Active/Inactive status with inline editing
- **Version Control**: Automatic version bumping on file updates

### ✅ Filtering & Search
- **ProcedureFilters**: Comprehensive filtering system
- **Multi-criteria Search**: Filter by category, status, and text search
- **Active Filter Display**: Visual representation of applied filters
- **Filter Persistence**: Maintains filter state during session

### ✅ Accessibility (WCAG AA Compliant)
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all components
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Focus Management**: Focus trapping in modals and proper focus return
- **Color Contrast**: All colors meet WCAG AA standards
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper table headers and form labels

## Technical Implementation

### Data Models
- `Procedure`: Main procedure entity with versioning
- `ProcedureCategory`: Color-coded categorization system  
- `ProcedureFileRef`: File reference with metadata
- Type-safe interfaces with proper validation

### Components Created
1. `ProcedureFilters.tsx` - Search and filtering interface
2. `ProcedureTable.tsx` - Data table with inline editing
3. `ProcedureModal.tsx` - Creation/editing modal with file upload
4. `ProcedureViewer.tsx` - PDF/Markdown viewer with navigation
5. `proceduresStore.ts` - Data management with IndexedDB integration

### Dependencies Added
- `react-pdf`: PDF viewing capability
- `react-markdown`: Safe Markdown rendering
- Configured PDF.js worker for proper PDF handling

### Storage Architecture
- **IndexedDB**: Binary file storage (PDFs, Markdown files)
- **localStorage**: Metadata and preferences
- **Mock Data**: Sample procedures and categories for development

```

## Testing
- Unit tests for store functionality
- Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation
- Component rendering tests for all major components

## Security Considerations
- Markdown rendering with HTML disabled for XSS protection
- File type validation and size limits
- Proper CORS handling for external links
- Input sanitization for all form fields

## Performance Features
- Lazy loading of file content
- Efficient IndexedDB queries
- Optimized re-renders with proper React patterns
- Sample file creation only when needed

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with IndexedDB support
- PDF.js worker configuration for cross-browser PDF viewing
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Fallback download options when viewing fails

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
- File versioning with diff viewing
- Collaborative editing capabilities  
- Advanced search with full-text indexing
- Bulk operations (import/export)
- Integration with work orders and maintenance plans

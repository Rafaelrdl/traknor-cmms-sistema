# PDF.js Worker Configuration Fix

## Problem
The application was failing to load PDF files with the error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@5.3.31/build/pdf.worker.min.js
```

## Root Cause
The PDF.js worker was being loaded from an external CDN (unpkg.com) which was being blocked by CORS policy or network restrictions in the GitHub Spark environment.

## Solution
Created a proper configuration system for PDF.js worker that:

1. **Created a dedicated configuration utility** (`src/utils/pdfConfig.ts`):
   - Automatically configures PDF.js worker on module import
   - Uses different strategies for development vs production
   - In development: disables worker to avoid CORS issues (uses main thread)
   - In production: attempts to use CDN worker with fallback

2. **Updated ProcedureViewer component**:
   - Imports the PDF configuration utility early
   - Removes inline worker configuration
   - Adds better error handling for PDF loading
   - Uses conditional worker disabling based on environment

3. **Enhanced error handling**:
   - Added loading spinners and error messages
   - Clear fallback options when PDF fails to load
   - Better logging for debugging

## Key Changes

### `src/utils/pdfConfig.ts` (New)
- Centralized PDF.js worker configuration
- Environment-specific handling
- Error handling and fallbacks

### `src/components/procedure/ProcedureViewer.tsx`
- Removed inline worker configuration
- Added import for PDF config utility
- Enhanced error handling and loading states
- Conditional worker disabling for development

### `src/App.tsx`
- Added early import of PDF configuration

## Benefits
1. **Resolves CORS errors** in development environment
2. **Better error handling** for PDF loading failures
3. **Environment-specific configuration** for optimal performance
4. **Centralized configuration** for easier maintenance
5. **Fallback mechanisms** ensure functionality even when CDN is unavailable

## Testing
- PDF viewing should now work without CORS errors
- Error messages are more descriptive
- Loading states are better handled
- Files can still be downloaded even if viewing fails

## Notes
- In development mode, PDFs are processed on the main thread (slower but reliable)
- In production, worker is used if available for better performance
- All PDF functionality remains intact with improved reliability

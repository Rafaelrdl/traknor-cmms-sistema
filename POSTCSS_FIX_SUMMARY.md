# PostCSS Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The project was experiencing conflicts between Tailwind CSS v4 Vite plugin and PostCSS plugin configurations. The error message indicated:
```
[postcss] It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration.
```

## Root Cause
The project was using both:
1. Tailwind CSS v4 Vite plugin (`@tailwindcss/vite` in vite.config.ts)
2. Tailwind CSS PostCSS plugin (`@tailwindcss/postcss` in postcss.config.js)
3. Direct Tailwind imports in CSS files (`@import "tailwindcss"`)

This created conflicts because Tailwind v4 with Vite plugin doesn't require PostCSS configuration or direct CSS imports.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated postcss.config.js
**Before:**
```javascript
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
export default {
  plugins: {
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### 2. Fixed src/main.css
Replaced corrupted content with clean structure:
```css
/* Structural CSS file - do not edit directly */
/* Import Spark styles */
@import "@github/spark/designer-styles.css";

/* Additional global styles can be added below */
```

### 3. Updated src/styles/theme.css
Removed Tailwind CSS direct imports:
- Removed `@import "tailwindcss";`
- Removed `@import 'tailwindcss/theme' layer(theme);`
- Removed `@import 'tailwindcss/preflight' layer(base);`

### 4. Removed Unnecessary Dependency
Uninstalled `@tailwindcss/postcss` since it's not needed with the Vite plugin approach.

## Result
The project now uses a clean Tailwind CSS v4 configuration with:
- ✅ Vite plugin for CSS processing (`@tailwindcss/vite`)
- ✅ PostCSS only for autoprefixer
- ✅ No conflicting imports or configurations
- ✅ Proper CSS structure maintained

## Verification
The project should now build and run without PostCSS-related errors. The Tailwind CSS processing is handled entirely by the Vite plugin, which is the recommended approach for Tailwind v4.
